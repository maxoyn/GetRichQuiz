        Reports	show	that	1	in	15	teenagers	self	harm	but	the	true	figure	could	be	even	higher.	Around
        19,000	young	people	are	admitted	to	hospital	for	deliberate	self	harm	each	year.
        Self	harm	is	a	sign	of	emotional	distress.	Cutting	is	one	form	of	self	harm.	Others	include	burning,
        hitting,	bruising	or	poisoning.
        Self	harm	is	more	common	than	most	people	realise	and	it	affects	boys	as	well	as	girls.	Young	people
        who	self	harm	experience	a	lot	of	stigma.	They	may	be	bullied	as	a	result	which	will	make	them	feel
        even	worse.	They	are	also	more	likely	to	tell	a	friend	than	anyone	else	so	it	is	important	to	support
        your	friends	and	be	there	for	them.	If	a	friend	tells	you	they	self	harm,	don’t	be	afraid;	the	best	thing
        you	can	do	is	listen.	If	you	feel	worried	or	feel	out	of	your	depth	ask	someone	you	trust	or	a
        professional	for	advice.

        Recent	research	claimed	that	people	using	cannabis	are	40%	more	likely	than	non-users	to	suffer	a
        psychotic	illness	such	as	schizophrenia.	The	study	found	the	most	frequent	users	of	cannabis	have
        twice	the	risk	of	non-users	of	developing	psychotic	symptoms,	such	as	hallucinations	and	delusions.
        They	said	that	people	with	family	history	of	mental	illness	or	who	already	had	mental	health	issues
        should	avoid	using	cannabis.

        Violence	can	be	a	feature	of	mental	illness	and	every	year	in	England	and	Wales	on	average	55	people
        are	killed	by	persons	judged	to	be	mentally	ill.
        But	you	are	70	times	more	likely	to	be	killed	on	the	roads.	Indeed	the	risk	of	being	killed	by	a	mentally
        ill	person	is	about	the	same	as	the	risk	of	being	struck	by	lightning.	People	with	mental	illness	are	far
        more	likely	to	hurt	themselves	than	someone	else.
        Of	the	55	people	killed	in	a	year	by	people	who	were	mentally	ill	only	5	are	likely	to	be	strangers.	The
        victims	are	usually	people	known	to	the	person.
        You	are	9	times	more	likely	to	be	killed	by	someone	under	the	influence	of	drugs	or	drink	-	You	are	at
        far	greater	risk	from	heavy	drinkers	than	they	are	from	the	mentally	ill.		Yet	our	fear	of	violence	from
        the	mentally	ill	is	disproportionate	to	the	actual	risk.
        Why?	The	media	have	in	the	past	been	intent	on	stressing	the	dangers	posed	by	the	mentally	ill	with
        sensationalist	headlines	like	‘mad	axe	man’	etc.	And	this	creates	a	vicious	circle	–	as	people	become
        more	fearful	so	those	with	mental	illness	experience	more	stigma	and	discrimination	adding	to	the
        burden	they	already	experience	through	their	mental	health	condition.
        What	can	we	do?	Education	-	Get	the	facts	about	mental	health	issues	and	treat	those	experiencing
        difficulties	with	compassion,	respect	and	support	not	hostility	and	fear.
